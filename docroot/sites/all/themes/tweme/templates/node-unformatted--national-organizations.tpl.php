<h2>National Organizations page v2</h2>

TFAPW-122


organizations are listed in three columns
		all organizations are sorted alphabetically by country name, going from top to bottom of each column (not sideways across columns)
		organizations are distributed as evenly as possible with the right most column being shorter than the others if needed
				in some cases the left column would be longer than the two others, e.g. if there were only 28 organizations
each organization is listed with
		country name
		organization name
organization name is clickable and will take the user to the node page for that organization
two content fields are available at the bottom of the page, side by side under a section title (see mockup http://www.teachforall.org/comps/tfall-national-orgs.html)
page will have a button/link at the bottom with
		title
		internal target URL
